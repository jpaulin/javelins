A simple 'blog' if you will. 

Runs when you have NodeJS installed. 

This server will create a listener on port 3000 (you can choose the port)

## Changing port

You can change the variable:
```
    const port = 3000
``` 
to a number where you want the server to listen.

If for example you've set port=2999, then open your web browser:
http://localhost:2999/

to see content.

## Running the server

node ./index.js

Soon a text should appear on your console:
'Running!'
