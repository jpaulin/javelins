This is a rather free-form pad for scribing
ideas to the game. They can be casual brainfarts,

## Complex in-game machinics: Office Kitchen

### The Pristine ClearWater AI dishwasher that whines for updates 

A Dishwashing machine with sophisticated sensor fusion and 
a 'Pristine ClearWater AI': an embedded control program, 
that has a flag for keeping Things Simple. 

The flag keeps track of whether ALL dishes inside are clean,
or does the wash-cycle need to be initiated. The problem
has haunted humanity since 1960s. But it became ever more prevalent
with the advent of shared office spaces and co-working spaces,
where people of mixed dish-washing strategies mingle together.

The author has had some sense of humor by picking port
666 TCP as the main comms used by the updates. So, configure
this, or you're looking at manual washing / delegating dishes.

PROBLEM:  dishwasher needs updates through the local WIFI, on specific port
SOLVE:    configure the office AP WIFI's firewall to allow TCP "in" on port 666
PRIZE:    epic reputation
